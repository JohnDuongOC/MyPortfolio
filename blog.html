                January, the time where most people decide to start new goals or
                attempt old ones. Motivation is one of the biggest drivers for
                these goals, but relying solely on that will result in burnout
                within a couple days or weeks. In times when motivation is
                absent,I realized that if my reasons for the goals are empty,
                I'll most likely quit early.
              </p>

                How I'm tackling my goal this year is to hold myself accountable
                and by posting my progress for the next 30 days on here. My goal
                for the next 30 days is to work on Javascript Fundamentals.
